Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup

This project demonstrates web scraping using the Beautiful Soup library.

Installation(MAC):
pip install beautifulSoup4
pip install requests

Overview:
I used the Beautiful Soup library to scrape data from webpages. The code was developed based on a youtube video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjKQ6V_ViQE) while using my own HTML.
This project mainly focuses on find/find_all, CSS select, and scrape table.
